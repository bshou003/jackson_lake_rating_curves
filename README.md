Information regarding the rating curves and discharge estimates for Jackson Lake
As of 2025/11/14:
For all rating curves and finalized data, the origin for the models was forced to 0. This is due to several reasons. The first is because at sites 10 and 17, discharge increases with decreasing stage height.
Continued discharge measurements in 2026 and using salt dilution at all sites will increase discharge measurement confidence.
As of now, sites 10, 17, 19, 20, 22, and 30 use a linear model. Not ideal, when addtional measurements are collected in 2026 these can be swapped to non-linear models.

Final data is located in the final data folder along with site number, name, lat., and long.
